# The Yield Curve

The US Treasury yield curve is an incredibly useful metric for measuring the
health of the US (and, by proxy, the global) economy.

I've been interested in bonds since my MBA, and have been wanting to go through
the Gundlach-recommended _Inside the Yield Curve_. The first step = getting a
framework for pulling this data from the UST webpage and (hopefully) displaying
it here on a daily-updated basis.
